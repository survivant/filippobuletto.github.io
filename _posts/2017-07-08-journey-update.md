# Welcome back

{% include toc icon="thumbs-o-up" %}

Maintaining my blog updated is a hard challenge :disappointed_relieved:

Today, I'm adding another post to share some results and some improvements I've made to my Master Plan.

# Updated Master Plan

What remains the same:

 * [Goals](/fit-life-day-1/#goals)
 * [Tools](/fit-life-day-1/#tools)

## Updated plan description

After about 4 months I learned to know my body better, observing the reactions to muscle stimulation I decided to deprecate the "Day ABCD" method and go for the "Superset Strategy".

The result is a mix of my previous exercises **one training day every two days**, trying to respect the superset strategy, dedicating **a weekend day to a bike ride**.

### Superset Strategy brief description:

<cite>A superset is a quick series of two exercises that work opposing body parts, such as your chest and your back. You don’t rest between the exercises, other than the time it takes to transition from one to the other. The main benefit of the superset is an increase in your workout’s intensity. Instead of taking a typical minute or two of rest and allowing your heart rate to drop, you keep your heart pumping for a longer period and, therefore, you burn more calories. Additionally, you rest one muscle group while simultaneously working another.</cite>

## Training day "Superset inspired"

 * Warm-up: free bike ride, medium heart rate _10 minutes_
 * Hammer Handle Pull-up Bar _1 set of 10 reps, no rest!_
 * Incline Press With Dumbbells [^1] _1 set of 15 reps, no rest!_
 * Bulgarian Split Squat _1 set of 10 reps, no rest!_
 * Kick Back and Rowing _1 set of 10 reps, no rest!_
 * Pronation Pull-up _1 set of 10 reps, no rest!_
 * Bench Press With Dumbbells _1 set of 15 reps, no rest!_
 * Lying Triceps Extensions _1 set of 10 reps, no rest!_
 * Abdominal Crunches On Bench _1 set of 30 repetitions, no rest!_
 * Supination Pull-up _1 set of 10 reps_
 * 2 minutes rest, lowering heart rate.
 * **Repeat!**
