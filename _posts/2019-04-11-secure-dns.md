# Problem statement

What is a _DNS_?

> The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.

The problem with DNS is primarily **privacy**.

From the [dnsprivacy.org](dnsprivacy.org) site I've extracted some from the many issues:

- Whilst the data in the DNS is public, **individual transactions** made by an end user should not be public.
- However DNS queries are sent in **clear text** (using UDP or TCP) which means passive eavesdroppers can **observe all the DNS lookups** performed.
- **Some ISPs log DNS queries** at the resolver and share this information with third-parties in ways not known or obvious to end users.

## Is there any solution

There are multiple solutions:

- DNS-over-TLS (DoT)
- DNS-over-HTTP (DoH)
- DNS-over-DTLS
- DNSCrypt
- DNS-over-HTTPS (proxied)
- DNS-over-QUIC
- DNSCurve

In this post I'm going to describe how to implement DNS-over-TLS (DoT) that can be shared across all your private LAN, for further information on how the various solutions compare [see here](https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+-+The+Solutions).

## DNS-over-TLS (DoT)

The use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides privacy for DNS.

Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network.

## DoT implementation: Stubby

[Stubby](https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/About+Stubby) is an application that acts as a local DNS Privacy stub resolver (using DNS-over-TLS). Stubby encrypts DNS queries sent from a client machine (desktop or laptop) to a DNS Privacy resolver increasing end user privacy.

### Raspbian installation

Install build dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git automake build-essential libssl-dev libtool m4 autoconf libyaml-dev
```

Clone and configure getdns project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getdnsapi/getdns.git
cd getdns
git submodule update --init
libtoolize -ci
autoreconf -fi
mkdir -v build && cd build
../configure --prefix=/usr/local --without-libidn --without-libidn2 --enable-stub-only --with-stubby
```

Build and install:

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Install runtime dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install -y libev4 libevent-core-2.0.5 libuv1 libidn11 dns-root-data libunbound2
cd ~
wget http://pyyaml.org/download/libyaml/yaml-0.2.2.tar.gz
tar xvf yaml-0.2.2.tar.gz
cd yaml-0.2.2
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Edit stubby configuration:

```bash
vi /usr/local/etc/stubby/stubby.yml
````

My configuration uses cloudflare dns as first choice and quad9 as fallback:

```yaml
resolution_type: GETDNS_RESOLUTION_STUB
# Enable DoT
dns_transport_list:
  - GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS
# Strict mode TLS only
tls_authentication: GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
tls_query_padding_blocksize: 128
edns_client_subnet_private : 1
# Set to 0 to treat the upstreams below as an ordered list and use a single
# upstream until it becomes unavailable, then use the next one.
round_robin_upstreams: 0
idle_timeout: 10000
# Set the listen addresses for the stubby DAEMON. IPv4 only.
listen_addresses:
  - 127.0.0.1@5300
# Require DNSSEC validation.
dnssec: GETDNS_EXTENSION_TRUE
appdata_dir: "/var/cache/stubby"
upstream_recursive_servers:
## Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1
  - address_data: 1.1.1.1
    tls_auth_name: "cloudflare-dns.com"
  - address_data: 1.0.0.1
    tls_auth_name: "cloudflare-dns.com"
## Quad 9 'secure' service - Filters, does DNSSEC, doesn't send ECS
  - address_data: 9.9.9.9
    tls_auth_name: "dns.quad9.net"
```

Install it:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/install -Dm644 /usr/local/etc/stubby/stubby.yml /etc/stubby.yml
```

Create a _systemd_ service:

```bash
sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/stubby.service
```

With content:

```text
[Unit]
Description=Stubby DNS resolver
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/stubby -C /etc/stubby.yml
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start it

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable stubby
sudo systemctl start stubby
```

### Pi-hole

Combining Stubby with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) we can obtain a perfect match of privacy and performance.

Installing it is quick and easy, just follow the [documentation site](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/basic-install/).

## Benchmark

Using [dnsperftest](https://github.com/cleanbrowsing/dnsperftest/) script results are pretty good:

```bash
bash ./dnstest.sh | sort -k 22 -n
