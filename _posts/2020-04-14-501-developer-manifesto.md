# The 501 Developer Manifesto

We are software developers who take pride in our work but choose not to be wholly defined by it.
As such, we are proud to say that we value:

- **Our families** <sub>over</sub> the commercial goals of business owners
- **Free time** <sub>over</sub> free snacks
- **Living our lives** <sub>over</sub> maintaining our personal brands
- **Sustainable pace** <sub>over</sub> muscle-man heroics
- Our **personal creative projects** <sub>over</sub> commercial products the world doesn't need
- Having **money for stuff** <sub>over</sub> getting free swag and work overtime
- Playing fußball **in the pub with our friends** <sub>over</sub> playing fußball in the office with our team leader
- **Not being a d*ck** <sub>over</sub> being a rockstar
